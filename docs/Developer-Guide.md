## OAP Building

To clone OAP project, use
```shell script
git clone -b <tag-version> https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/OAP.git
cd OAP
```

#### Prerequisites for Building
OAP is built using [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and Java8. You need to install the required packages on the build system listed below. 

- [Cmake](https://help.directadmin.com/item.php?id=494)
- [Memkind](https://github.com/memkind/memkind/tree/v1.10.1-rc2)
- [Vmemcache](https://github.com/pmem/vmemcache)
- [HPNL](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/HPNL)
- [PMDK](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk)  
- [GCC > 7](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/InstallingGCC)
- **Requirements for Shuffle Remote PMem Extension**  
If enable Shuffle Remote PMem extension with RDMA, you can refer to [Shuffle Remote PMem Extension Guide](../oap-shuffle/RPMem-shuffle/README.md) to configure and validate RDMA in advance.  

We provide scripts to help automatically install all dependencies except RDMA, run:
```shell script
sh $OAP_HOME/dev/install-oap-dependencies.sh
```
If you want to use Shuffle Remote PMem Extension feature with RDMA and have completed the RDMA configuring and validating steps, execute the following commands to run the preparing process:
```shell script
sh $OAP_HOME/dev/install-oap-dependencies.sh --with-rdma
```

Run the following command to learn more.

```shell script
sh $OAP_HOME/dev/scripts/prepare_oap_env.sh --help
```

Run the following command to automatically install specific dependency such as Maven.

```shell script
sh $OAP_HOME/dev/scripts/prepare_oap_env.sh --prepare_maven
```

***NOTE:*** If you use `install-oap-dependencies.sh` or `prepare_oap_env.sh` to install GCC, or your GCC is not installed in the default path, please ensure you have exported `CC` (and `CXX`) before calling maven.
```shell script
export CXX=$OAPHOME/dev/thirdparty/gcc7/bin/g++
export CC=$OAPHOME/dev/thirdparty/gcc7/bin/gcc
```

#### Building


To build OAP package, use
```shell script
sh $OAPHOME/dev/compile-oap.sh
#or
mvn clean -DskipTests package
```

#### Building Specified Module
```shell script
sh $OAPHOME/dev/compile-oap.sh --oap-cache
#or
mvn clean -pl com.intel.oap:oap-cache -am package
```

#### Running Test

To run all the tests, use
```shell script
mvn clean test
```

#### Running Specified Test
```shell script
mvn clean -pl com.intel.oap:oap-cache -am test
```

#### OAP Building with PMem

#### Prerequisites for building with PMem support

When use SQL Index and Data Source Cache with PMem, finish steps of [Prerequisites for building](#Prerequisites-for-building) to ensure needed dependencies have been installed.
##### Building package
You need to add `-Ppersistent-memory` to build with PMem support. For `noevict` cache strategy, you also need to build with `-Ppersistent-memory` parameter.
```shell script
mvn clean -q -Ppersistent-memory -DskipTests package
```
for vmemcache cache strategy, please build with command:
```shell script
mvn clean -q -Pvmemcache -DskipTests package
```
You can build with command to use all of them:
```shell script
mvn clean -q -Ppersistent-memory -Pvmemcache -DskipTests package
```


#### OAP Packaging 
If you want to generate a release package after you mvn package all modules, use the following command under the directory dev, then you can find a tarball named oap-$VERSION-bin-spark-2.4.4.tar.gz in dev/release-package dictionary.
```shell script
sh $OAPHOME/dev/compile-oap.sh
```
